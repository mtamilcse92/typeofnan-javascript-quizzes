What's the value of output?

```javascript
const output = `Soon we must all choose between what is ${[] ? 'right' : 'wrong'} and what is ${(() => false) ? 'difficult' : 'easy'}`
```

<!-- explanation -->

As [] is a truthy value, the above ternary condition returns 'right'.

We just defined the method but not calling it. Function is a truthy value is Javascript, hence 'difficult' appends to the string.
