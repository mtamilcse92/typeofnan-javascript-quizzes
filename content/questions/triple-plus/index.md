Consider the following code block. What gets logged?

```javascript
let b = "4";

console.log(b +++ 3, b);
```

<!-- explanation -->

The Postfix Increment operator (`++`) takes precedence over the addition operator (`+`). The Postfix Increment operator also coerces strings to numbers. It uses the coerced number in the current expression, and the incremented value is not available until the following expression. So `"4"` is converted to `4`, then `3` is added. Then `4` is incremented to `5`, which is visible when `b` is passed as the second argument to `console.log`
