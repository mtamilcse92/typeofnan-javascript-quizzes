      <h1>Why I Make These Quizzes</h1>
      <p>
        These quizzes are intended to be fun ways to test
        your JavaScript knowledge. Many of them are tricky
        and dive into subjects that tripped me up when I was
        first learning the language. I find the concepts
        underlying each of these questions to be important
        to know as a JavaScript developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, and fairly importantly, I'm considered a
        senior developer and would probably have trouble
        with a lot of these questions had I not made them
        myself. Please don't be hard on yourself as you
        attempt these questions; we're all still learning!
      </p>
      <button
        className="ui button"
        onClick={props.closeModal}
      >
        Close
      </button>
    </Modal>
  );
};
